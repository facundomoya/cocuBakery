# **COCU Bakery**

## Project Description

The COCU Bakery project is a project that encompasses five different HTML pages and one CSS style sheet. The project has position practice, grid system, media queries, etc. It is a NON-FUNCTIONAL project made with the help of a toolkit called Bootstrap. It was used to facilitate the use of margin, padding or the grid system itself, using the twelve columns that Bootstrap provides us.

This project has the purpose of practicing with HTML5 and CSS3 using Bootstrap. It also has an error 404 page, it was made with a simple design to link certain parts of the project to said error given that, as said previously, the purpose of this project is practice and the use of good practices. The entire site is responsive for all types of devices and on all pages.
